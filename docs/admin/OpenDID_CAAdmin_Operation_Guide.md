# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. Overview

This document provides a guide on how to use the Open DID CA Admin Console. It explains the features and usage methods step by step so that administrators can efficiently manage and operate the CA (Client Application) system.

For the overall installation guide of OpenDID, please refer to [Open DID Installation Guide].

## 1.2. Admin Console Definition

The CA Admin Console is a web-based management tool for managing core functions of the CA server in the Open DID system, including certificate issuance, user management, and administrator privilege control. Administrators can monitor the overall status of the system and perform necessary configurations and tasks through this console.

The CA Admin Console provides the following main features:

- CA basic information management
- User information inquiry
- Administrator account management

<br/>

# 2. Basic Manual

## 2.1. Login

To access the Admin Console, follow these steps:

1. Open a web browser and access the CA Admin Console URL.

   ```

   ```

2. On the login screen, enter the administrator account email and password.
   - Default administrator account: <admin@opendid.omnione.net>
   - Initial password: password (must be changed upon first login)

3. Click the 'Login' button.

# 3. Feature-specific Detailed Manual

This chapter guides you through the detailed usage methods for the main features of the Open DID CA Admin Console.

## 3.1. CA Management

CA Management is a function for registration and status management of CA servers.

The CA server plays a role in guaranteeing users' Client Applications in the Open DID system.
Client Applications can use main functions such as DID creation and VC issuance using Wallet after being authenticated through the CA server.

CA registration is performed only once initially, and afterwards, you can check the registered status on the management screen.

<br/>

### 3.1.1. CA Registration

In the initial state where the CA server is not yet registered in the Open DID system,
only the `CA Registration` item is displayed in the left menu of the CA Admin Console.

CA registration proceeds sequentially through a total of 3 steps.

<br/>

**Step 1 - Enter CA Info**

This is the step to enter CA information.

| Item              | Description                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Name**          | Enter the name of the CA server. Example: `cas`                        |
| **CA URL**        | Enter the call URL of the CA server. Use format `http://<IP>:8094/cas` |
| **Test Connection Button** | Check if actual connection is possible with the entered URL.      |

<br/>

**Step 2 - Register DID Document**

In this step, the CA's DID Document is created and a registration request is made to TA Admin.
Once registered, the DID Document **cannot be changed or re-registered**.

▶ **Step 2-1: Generate DID Document**

Generate the CA's DID Document.

<img src="./images/3-1-2.ca-registration.png" width="600"/>

| Item               | Description                                                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GENERATE Button** | Generate the CA server's DID Document. Results are displayed in the lower area after generation |
| **Request Status Display** | Can be confirmed with green message when request is successful.    |

When the DID Document is successfully generated, **Step 2-2 area is automatically displayed on the screen**.

<br/>

▶ **Step 2-2 - Submit Registration Request**

Request registration of the generated DID Document to TA Admin.

<img src="./images/3-1-3.ca-registration.png" width="600"/>
<img src="./images/3-1-4.ca-registration.png" width="600"/>

| Item              | Description                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **REQUEST Button** | Send registration request for the generated DID Document to TA Admin.  |
| **Request Status Display** | Can be confirmed with green message when request is successful.    |

When the DID Document is successfully generated, **Step 2-3 area is automatically displayed on the screen**.

<br/>

▶ **Step 2-3 - Check Approval Status**

Check if the TA administrator has approved the DID Document registration request.

<img src="./images/3-1-5.ca-registration.png" width="600"/>

| Item              | Description                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **CHECK Button**  | Check if the TA administrator has approved the registration request.     |
| **Approval Status Display** | When approval is complete, you can move to the next step with a green message. |

<br/>

**Step 3 - Enroll Entity**

This is the step to request CA registration as an Entity to the TA server and receive a Certificate VC.

At this time, the registration request follows the flow of the user registration protocol (P132) among TA protocols,
and CA Admin performs the registration procedure by calling the APIs of that protocol.
